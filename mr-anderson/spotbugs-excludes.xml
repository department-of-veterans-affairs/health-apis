  <!--
  The stored procedure is invoked using a prepared statement which prevents SQL injection at
  query parameters. However, the schema is not known at compile time and can change in different
  environments. Furthermore, for SQL Server, the user used to connect to the database does not
  own the schema required to execute the stored procedure. The schema name must be provided in the
  form of "{call [schema].[procedure](param, param, param)}". Since JDBC does not allow for prepared
  statement parameters in the form of "{call [?].[procedure](?,?,?)}" we must build the stored
  procedure call string, "{call [" + schema + "].[procedure](?,?,?)}". This is safe because
  assertions verify the schema name contains only letters, numbers, and underscores which are not
  SQL sensitive characters. Query parameters are still protected using normal '?' syntax of
  prepared statements.
